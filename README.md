This is a very simple project for ParkingLot where we are using in-memory db and here we are not using mvc framework

At the time of parking vechile

    We are checking if parking is full or not
    If parking is not full then vechile is park and ticket is created
    Else mention parking is full

At the time of exit

    We calculate the amount than user need to pay
    and then exit the vechile
